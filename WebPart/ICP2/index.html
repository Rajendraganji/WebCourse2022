    <p>The short form "United States" is also standard. 
       Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and, 
       internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century,
       derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; both "Columbus" and "Columbia" appear frequently in U.S. place-names, 
       including Columbus, Ohio; Columbia, South Carolina; and the District of Columbia. Places and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere bear 
       the two names, including Col√≥n, Panama, the country of Colombia, the Columbia River, and Columbia University.
